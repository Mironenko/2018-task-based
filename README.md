### Run services

You need `docker-ce 18.09.0` and `docker-compose 1.23.1` to run. File `dock` imitates docker-composer for multiple folders.

- `./dock up -d` - run all services in background
- `./dock down` - stop and delete all services
- `./dock restart` - restart all services

Full list of commands available on `docker-compose --help`
